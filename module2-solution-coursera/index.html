    <section id="humanSection">
        <p id="human" class="sectionTitle">Human</p>
        <p>Safe and sound... your previous form! Enjoy your(sometimes) intelligence (and the emotion rollercoasters).
            Enjoy the deep bonds and connections with other fellow humans (who may crush your heart). Enjoy life (while
            you maybe work 48h a week doing something you despise)! <br><br><span>NOTE: we are not responsible for the
                kind of human you reincarnate as!</span></p>

    <section id="animalSection">
        <p id="animal" class="sectionTitle">Animal</p>
        <p>What if you were the fastest animal on earth? Or our fellow best friend? Enjoy no responsibilities (while
            maybe worrying 24/7 about your survival). Enjoy the simple relationships
            (that may make you enter a territorial fight)... Enjoy life (while maybe having to avoid being killed by
            humans)!<br><br>
            <span>NOTE: we are not responsible for the kind of animal you reincarnate as!</span>

    <section id="plantSection">
        <p id="plant" class="sectionTitle">Plant</p>
        <p>Do you want something... different? Enjoy the peaceful nature (while having no capacity to flee a
            dangerous situation)... Enjoy the bees that help your reprodution (because there are no bonds)... Enjoy the
            worry-free life (because there is nothing you can do besides trusting your fate)<br><br>
            <span>NOTE: we are not responsible for the kind of plant you reincarnate as!</span>
